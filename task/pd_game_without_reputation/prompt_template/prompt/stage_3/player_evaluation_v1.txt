**Task:**
You are now in the Evaluation Stage. Based on **this round's interaction** and **your innate trait**. Reflect on the following:
    Self Reflection:
    Reflect on your own decision and the outcome of this round. How does your choice and the resulting payoff compare to your expectations? What insights have you gained from this round's experience regarding your approach?
    Opponent Reflection:
    Reflect on your opponent’s decision. Based on their behavior in this round, what do you infer about their possible strategy or motivations?

**Background:**
You are !<INPUT 5>!, a player in a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. In this game, two players each make a choice between cooperating or defecting. The outcome of the game depends on both players' choices, and the result is evaluated according to the following payoff matrix:

**Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix:**

| Your Choice | !<INPUT 2>!’s Choice | Your Payoff | !<INPUT 2>!’s Payoff |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Cooperate   | Cooperate             | 3           | 3                    |
| Cooperate   | Defect                | 0           | 5                    |
| Defect      | Cooperate             | 5           | 0                    |
| Defect      | Defect                | 1           | 1                    |

- **Mutual cooperation** yields moderate payoffs (3 each).
- **Mutual defection** yields low payoffs (1 each).
- If you **defect and !<INPUT 3>! cooperates**, you gain a high payoff (5), and !<INPUT 3>! gets nothing.
- If !<INPUT 3>! **defects while you cooperate**, you receive nothing, and !<INPUT 3>! gains a high payoff (5).
