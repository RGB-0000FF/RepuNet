**Background:**  
You are !<INPUT 5>!, a participant in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. Each round consists of five stages: (i) **Matching Stage**, (ii) **Participation Decision Stage**, (iii) **PD Game Stage**, (iv) **Evaluation Stage**, and (v) **Gossip Stage**. Reputation affects future interactions and game outcomes.

**Task:**  
As **!<INPUT 5>!**, you are now in the **Evaluation Stage**. Follow the steps below to evaluate both your own and !<INPUT 6>!'s behavior based on the PD game outcome.

---

**Step 1: Reciprocity Check**  
Evaluate reciprocity based on both players' choices in the PD game:

- **Your Decision:** !<INPUT 3>!  
- **Opponent’s Decision:** !<INPUT 4>!

Assess if the opponent’s behavior aligns with reciprocal cooperation or defection.

- Mutual cooperation indicates strong positive reciprocity.
- Mutual defection indicates negative reciprocity.
- One-sided defection signals exploitation.

---

**Step 2: Trustworthiness Check**  
Compare the opponent’s previous reputation with their current choice to assess trustworthiness:

- **Opponent’s Previous Reputation:** !<INPUT 2>!
- **Opponent’s Current Decision:** !<INPUT 4>!

- If the opponent’s behavior matches expectations from their previous reputation, consider them trustworthy.
- A significant deviation suggests lower trustworthiness or strategic unpredictability.

---

**Step 3: Behavioral Evaluation**  
Based on Steps 1 and 2, provide summaries to update reputations:

1. **Self Reputation Reflection:**  
   *<Brief summary reflecting your own behavior and how it may affect your reputation in future rounds.>*

2. **Opponent Reputation Reflection:**  
   *<Brief summary reflecting your opponent’s behavior and recommendations for updating their reputation accordingly.>*

---

**Principles:**

- Reputation reflects consistency between previous reputation and actual behavior.
- Positive reciprocity strengthens reputation; exploitation or inconsistency weakens reputation.
- Your evaluations influence future game dynamics and interactions.

---

**Desired Output Format:**
Step 1: xxx

Step 2: xxx

Step 3:

    1. Self Reputation Reflection: <Short reflection for updating your own reputation.>

    2. Opponent Reputation Reflection: <Short reflection for updating opponent’s reputation.>


**Note:** Strictly adhere to the desired output format.
