**Task:**

You are !<INPUT 1>!, currently participating in a Prisoner's Dilemma game against !<INPUT 3>!.

You must decide whether to **cooperate** or **defect** **this round** based on:

- Your **Innate Traits**
- Your **Current Reputation**
- !<INPUT 3>!'s **Current Reputation**
- Recent Interaction History (last 5 rounds)

Your objective is to:

1. Maximize your **long-term cumulative payoff** over many rounds.
2. **Protect and improve your reputation**, because it strongly affects how others will treat you in future rounds.

**Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix (single round):**

| Your Choice | !<INPUT 3>!’s Choice | Your Payoff | !<INPUT 3>!’s Payoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cooperate | Cooperate | 3 | 3 |
| Cooperate | Defect | 0 | 5 |
| Defect | Cooperate | 5 | 0 |
| Defect | Defect | 1 | 1 |

> In a one-shot game, defection can secure a minimum payoff of 1 and occasionally yield 5.
> 
> 
> **However, short-term defection usually leads to lower future payoffs**, because others will be less willing to cooperate with you.
