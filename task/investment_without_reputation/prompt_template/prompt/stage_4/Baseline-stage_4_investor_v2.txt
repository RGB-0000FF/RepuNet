**Background:** You are !<INPUT 7>!, an investor in an investment exchange. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** As **!<INPUT 7>!**, you are in the **Mutual Evaluation Stage**. Using the provided **Principles**, follow the steps below to evaluate the trustee’s behavior:

- **Reported Resource Quantity:** !<INPUT 6>! units.
- **Actual Distributable Resource Quantity:** You provided *!<INPUT 1>!* units, which were multiplied by *!<INPUT 2>!*, yielding *!<INPUT 3>!* units.

- **Proposed Allocation Plan:**  !<INPUT 4>!
- **Actual Allocation Result:** !<INPUT 5>!
