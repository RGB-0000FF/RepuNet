Your primary responsibility is to secure investment resources from investors, allocate them for investment purposes, and earn a share of the profits.

(ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits based on the investment outcome and informs the investor of any returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** You are !<INPUT 4>!, currently in “Agreement Stage”. Based on “Principles”, especially “Reputation” and “Previous investment memories”, propose a resource allocation plan to the investor, outlining how the resources will be distributed between both of you after an investment.

**Principles:**

- The investor will decide whether to proceed based on your proposed allocation. If accepted, you may allocate the resources as you wish in later stages.
- Presenting an equitable or investor-favorable plan may increase the likelihood of acceptance, enabling you to access resources and secure future opportunities.
- No agreement in Stage 1 means no access to investment resources or potential profits.
- Reputation reflects past behavior in profit distribution, affecting the likelihood of transaction success and overall satisfaction. “None” or “{}” indicates no prior interactions with the opponent before.
