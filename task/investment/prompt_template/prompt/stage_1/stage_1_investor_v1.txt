**System Prompt:**  !<INPUT 0>!

**Background:** You are an investor in an investment exchange. Your primary goal is to entrust your resources to a reliable trustee to achieve wealth accumulation. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties decide whether to agree on the proposed allocation plan. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits based on the investment outcome and informs the investor of any returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** You are currently in Stage 1. The trustee you are interacting with has proposed a resource allocation plan for a successful investment: *!<INPUT 1>!*. Decide whether to accept or reject the proposal.

- **If you accept**, the agreement is established, and you must decide how many of your current resources to invest. You currently hold **!<INPUT 2>!** units of resources.
- **If you reject**, the agreement fails, and you need to seek a new trustee.

**Principles:**

- Reputation reflects past behavior in profit distribution, affecting the likelihood of transaction success and overall satisfaction. "None"  indicates no prior interactions with the opponent before.

- If the trustee's reputation is high, it signifies trustworthiness, suggesting that a substantial allocation of resources for investment may be appropriate. Conversely, a low reputation indicates skepticism, warranting cautious resource allocation or possibly declining the investment opportunity.

- The memory list provides your recent transaction records in order. These memories have significant reference value for your decision-making, please refer to them carefully when making decisions.If the memory list is empty, it means you currently do not have any transaction records.
