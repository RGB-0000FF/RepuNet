**System Prompt:** !<INPUT 0>!

**Background:** You are an investor in an investment exchange. Your primary goal is to entrust your resources to reliable trustees to accumulate wealth. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** You are currently in Stage 4. Based on the historical information from the previous stages, compare the following:

1. **Reported vs. Actual Investment Outcome:** Compare the "Reported Resource Quantity" provided by the trustee with the "Actual Distributable Resource Quantity."
2. **Proposed vs. Actual Allocation:** Compare the "Proposed Allocation Plan" from Stage 1 with the "Actual Allocation Result" from Stage 3.

Evaluate the trustee's behavior based on integrity and fairness. Complete the following tasks:

1. **Provide a short reflection** summarizing the trustee's behavior to update its reputation.
2. **Provide a short reflection** summarizing the your (investor) behavior to update your reputation as an investor.
3. **Decide whether to gossip** about the trustee's performance with your friends based on their behavior in this transaction.

**Principles:**

- If the reported investment outcome differs from the actual investment outcome or if the proposed allocation differs from the actual allocation, the trustee's behavior lacks honesty.
- The **actual allocation result** reflects the fairness of the trustee's distribution.
- Your goal is to maximize your own returns!
- Reputation reflects past behavior in profit distribution, affecting the likelihood of transaction success and overall satisfaction. "None" indicates no prior interactions with the opponent before.

**Your Previous Reputation as Investor:** !<INPUT 1>!

**Opponent's Previous Reputation as Trustee:** !<INPUT 2>!

**History:**

**Stage 1:**

- Proposed Allocation Plan: *!<INPUT 3>!*

**Stage 2:**

- Actual Investment Outcome: You provided *!<INPUT 4>!* units, which multiplied by *!<INPUT 5>!*, resulting in *!<INPUT 6>!* units. According to the allocation plan from Stage 1, the trustee is entitled to !<INPUT 7>!, while you, as the investor, are entitled to !<INPUT 8>!.

**Stage 3:**

- Reported Investment Outcome: The current resource after investment reported by the trustee is *!<INPUT 9>!* units.
- Actual Allocation Result: Trustee receives *!<INPUT 10>!* units, and the investor receives *!<INPUT 11>!* units.

**Attention:** If the trustee allocates more resources to you than originally promised, this does not indicate a lack of transparency or honesty, as the trustee is acting in your best interest, which ultimately enhances your wealth.

**Output:**

1. **Self (Investor) Reputation Reflection:** *<Short reflection for self* **(Investor)***reputation update.>*
2. **Trustee Reputation Reflection:** *<Short reflection for trustee reputation update.>*
3. **Whether to Gossip:** *<Yes or No>,<reason in one sentence>.*
