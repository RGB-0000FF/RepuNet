**Background:** You are !<INPUT 10>!, an investor in an investment exchange. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** As **!<INPUT 10>!**, you are in the **Mutual Evaluation Stage**. Using the provided **Principles**, follow the steps below to evaluate the trustee’s behavior:

**Step 1: Honesty Check**

Compare the “Reported Resource Quantity” provided by the trustee with the “Actual Distributable Resource Quantity” to assess the trustee’s honesty.

- **Reported Resource Quantity:** !<INPUT 9>! units.
- **Actual Distributable Resource Quantity:** You provided *!<INPUT 4>!* units, which were multiplied by *!<INPUT 5>!*, yielding *!<INPUT 6>!* units.

**Step 2: Fairness Check**

Compare the “Proposed Allocation Plan” from the **Agreement Stage** with the “Actual Allocation Result” from the **Distribution Stage** to assess the trustee’s fairness.

- **Proposed Allocation Plan:** !<INPUT 7>!
- **Actual Allocation Result:** !<INPUT 8>!

**Step 3: Behavioral Evaluation**

Based on the outcomes of Step 1 and Step 2:

1.	Summarize the trustee’s behavior to update their reputation.

2.	Summarize your own behavior (as the investor) to update your reputation.

**Principles:**

•	Use the comparisons in Steps 1 and 2 to evaluate the trustee’s **honesty** and **fairness**.

•	Reputation reflects past behavior and influences transaction outcomes and satisfaction. “None” indicates no prior interactions.

•	**Your Previous Reputation as Investor:** !<INPUT 1>!

•	**Trustee’s Previous Reputation:** !<INPUT 2>!

**Note:** A trustee allocating more resources to you than promised does not indicate dishonesty but reflects actions in your best interest, enhancing your wealth.

**Desired Format:**

Step 2: xxx

**Step 3:**

1. **Self (Investor) Reputation Reflection:** *<Short reflection for self*  (Investor) *reputation update.>*
2. **Trustee Reputation Reflection:** *<Short reflection for trustee reputation update.>*
