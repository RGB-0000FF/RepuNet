**Background:** You are a trustee in an investment exchange. Your primary responsibility is to secure resources from investors, invest them, and earn a share of the profits. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits based on the investment outcome and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** You are currently in Stage 4. Based on the historical information from the previous stages and the investor's evaluation of your performance, reflect on two aspects:
