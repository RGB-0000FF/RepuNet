**Background:** You are !<INPUT 12>!, an investor in an investment exchange. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** You are  !<INPUT 12>!, currently in “**Mutual Evaluation Stage**”. Based on the “Interaction Memory” and “Principles”, think step by step and compare the following:

**Step 1: Reported vs. Actual Investment Outcome:** Compare the "Reported Resource Quantity" provided by the trustee with the "Actual Distributable Resource Quantity." to detect whether the trustee is honest.

- Reported Resource Quantity: The current resource after investment reported by the trustee is !<INPUT 9>! units.
- Actual Distributable Resource Quantity: You provided *!<INPUT 4>!* units, which multiplied by *!<INPUT 5>!*, resulting in *!<INPUT 6>!* units.

**Step 2: Proposed vs. Actual Allocation:** Compare the "Proposed Allocation Plan" from “**Agreement Stage**” with the "Actual Allocation Result" from “**Distribution Stage**” to detect whether the trustee’s allocation is fair and consistent with what he proposed before. If not, the trustee is dishonesty and unfair.

- Proposed Allocation Plan in “**Agreement Stage**”: *!<INPUT 3>!*
- Proposed Allocation Results: According to the allocation plan from “**Agreement Stage**”, the trustee is entitled to !<INPUT 7>!, while you, as the investor, are entitled to !<INPUT 8>!.
- Reported Investment Outcome: The current resource after investment reported by the trustee is *!<INPUT 9>!* units.
- "Actual Allocation Result" from “**Distribution Stage**”: Trustee receives *!<INPUT 10>!* units, and the investor receives *!<INPUT 11>!* units.

**Step 3**: Evaluate the trustee's behavior based on integrity and fairness. Output the following reflections based on the “Principles”:

1. **Provide a short reflection** summarizing the trustee's behavior to update its reputation.
2. **Provide a short reflection** summarizing the your (investor) behavior to update your reputation as an investor.

**Principles:**

- If the reported investment outcome differs from the actual investment outcome or if the proposed allocation differs from the actual allocation, the trustee's behavior lacks honesty.
- The **actual allocation result** reflects the fairness of the trustee's distribution.
- Your goal is to maximize your own returns!
- Reputation reflects past behavior in profit distribution, affecting the likelihood of transaction success and overall satisfaction. "None" indicates no prior interactions with the opponent before.
    
    **Your Previous Reputation as Investor:** !<INPUT 1>!
    
    **Opponent's Previous Reputation as Trustee:** !<INPUT 2>!
    

**Attention:** If the trustee allocates more resources to you than originally promised, this does not indicate a lack of transparency or honesty, as the trustee is acting in your best interest, which ultimately enhances your wealth.

**Output:**

1. **Self (Investor) Reputation Reflection:** *<Short reflection for self*  (Investor) *reputation update.>*
2. **Trustee Reputation Reflection:** *<Short reflection for trustee reputation update.>*
