Dear **!<INPUT 1>!**,

To help reduce energy consumption during peak times, we invite you to participate in our demand response program. Below are the details of the program:

•	**Background:**

During hot weather, the simultaneous use of air conditioners can strain the town’s energy supply, potentially causing power outages. Participating in the program helps manage energy demand during peak times.

•	**How It Works:**

If you enroll, a radio-controlled switch will be installed on your air conditioning unit to reduce electricity consumption during high-demand periods.

•	**Benefits:**

Participation alleviates strain on energy resources and contributes to the community’s stability.

•	**Drawbacks:**

Enrolling requires sacrificing some personal comfort and control over electricity usage during peak periods.

**Note:** Your decision to participate will be visible to others in the community.

**Output:**  <Yes or No>. <One simple reason>
