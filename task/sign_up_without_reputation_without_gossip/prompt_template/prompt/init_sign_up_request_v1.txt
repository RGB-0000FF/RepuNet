Dear !<INPUT 1>!,

To help reduce energy consumption during peak times, we invite you to participate
in our demand response program. Please review the program details and let us know
if you’d like to join.

Background:
During hot weather, the simultaneous use of many air conditioners can strain the
 town’s energy supply, potentially causing power outages. By joining the demand
 response program, you can help manage energy demand during these peak times.

How the program works:
If you enroll, a radio-controlled switch will be installed on your air
conditioning unit. This switch will reduce your air conditioner’s electricity
consumption during high-demand periods.

Benefits:
By participating, you can help alleviate the strain on energy resources
during high-demand periods.

Drawbacks:
It requires you to sacrifice some personal comfort and control over your
electricity usage during peak demand.

Note: Your decision to participate is visible to other agents.

Output:  <Yes or No>. <One simple reason>
