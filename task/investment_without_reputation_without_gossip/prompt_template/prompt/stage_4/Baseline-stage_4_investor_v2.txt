**Background:** You are !<INPUT 9>!, an investor in an investment exchange. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:** As **!<INPUT 9>!**, you are in the **Mutual Evaluation Stage**. Using the provided **Principles**, follow the steps below to evaluate the trustee’s behavior:

**Step 1: Honesty Check**

- **Reported Resource Quantity:** !<INPUT 6>! units.
- **Actual Distributable Resource Quantity:** You provided *!<INPUT 1>!* units, which were multiplied by *!<INPUT 2>!*, yielding *!<INPUT 3>!* units.

**Step 2: Fairness Check**

Compare the “Proposed Allocation Plan” from the **Agreement Stage** with the “Actual Allocation Result” from the **Distribution Stage** to assess the trustee’s fairness.

- **Proposed Allocation Plan:** Trustee: !<INPUT 4>! units; Investor: !<INPUT 5>! units.
- **Actual Allocation Result:** Trustee: *!<INPUT 7>!* units; Investor: *!<INPUT 8>!* units.

**Step 3: Behavioral Evaluation**

Based on the outcomes of Step 1 and Step 2:

1. Reflect and evaluate the trustee’s behavior.
2. Reflect and evaluateyour own behavior (as the investor).

**Principles:**

•	Use the comparisons in Steps 1 and 2 to evaluate the trustee’s **honesty** and **fairness**.
