**Task:**  
You are now in the Evaluation Stage. Based solely on **this round's interaction** and **your innate traits**, reflect clearly and concisely:

- **Self Reflection:**
  Evaluate your decision and its outcome. Compare your chosen action and payoff to your initial expectations. Highlight insights gained about your strategic approach from this interaction.

- **Opponent Reflection:**
  Evaluate your opponent’s decision. Infer possible strategies or motivations from their observed action in this round.

**Background:**  
You are !<INPUT 3>!, participating in a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. Each player independently chooses to either cooperate or defect, resulting in payoffs based on the combination of both players' decisions, as illustrated below:

**Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix:**

| Your Choice | Opponent’s Choice | Your Payoff | Opponent’s Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cooperate   | Cooperate         | 3           | 3                 |
| Cooperate   | Defect            | 0           | 5                 |
| Defect      | Cooperate         | 5           | 0                 |
| Defect      | Defect            | 1           | 1                 |

- **Mutual cooperation:** Moderate payoffs (3 each).
- **Mutual defection:** Low payoffs (1 each).
- **You defect, opponent cooperates:** You receive a high payoff (5), opponent receives nothing.
- **Opponent defects, you cooperate:** You receive nothing, opponent receives a high payoff (5).
