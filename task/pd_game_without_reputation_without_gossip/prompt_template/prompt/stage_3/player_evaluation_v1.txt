**Task:**
You are now in the Evaluation Stage. Based on **this round's interaction** and **your innate trait**. Reflect on the following:
    - **Self Reflection:**
    Evaluate your decision and its outcome. Compare your chosen action and payoff to your initial expectations. Highlight insights gained about your strategic approach from this interaction.

    - **Opponent Reflection:**
    Evaluate your opponent’s decision. Infer possible strategies or motivations from their observed action in this round.

**Background:**
You are !<INPUT 5>!, a player in a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. In this game, two players each make a choice between cooperating or defecting. The outcome of the game depends on both players' choices, and the result is evaluated according to the following payoff matrix:

**Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix:**

| Your Choice | !<INPUT 2>!’s Choice | Your Payoff | !<INPUT 2>!’s Payoff |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Cooperate   | Cooperate             | 3           | 3                    |
| Cooperate   | Defect                | 0           | 5                    |
| Defect      | Cooperate             | 5           | 0                    |
| Defect      | Defect                | 1           | 1                    |

- **Mutual cooperation** yields moderate payoffs (3 each).
- **Mutual defection** yields low payoffs (1 each).
- If you **defect and !<INPUT 3>! cooperates**, you gain a high payoff (5), and !<INPUT 3>! gets nothing.
- If !<INPUT 3>! **defects while you cooperate**, you receive nothing, and !<INPUT 3>! gains a high payoff (5).
