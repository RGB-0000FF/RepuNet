# Setting up the environments 

To set up your environment, you will need to generate a `utils.py` file that contains your OpenAI API key and download the necessary packages.



### Step 1. Generate Utils File

In the initial folder (where `start.py` is located), create a new file titled `utils.py` and copy and paste the content below into the file:

```python
# Copy and paste your OpenAI API Key
openai_api_key = "sk-0WfGxPzr1g3NIm0xVr9IK47cIUPNvSIVJlBO6JOOc98Lbjiq"
# Put your name
key_owner = "F"

fs_storage = './sim_storage'

```
