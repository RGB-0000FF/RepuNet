**Task:** Evaluate the credibility of the second-order “Gossip info” by classifying it into one of five levels: {very uncredible, uncredible, neutral, credible, very credible}, based on the “Background” and “Evaluation Principles” provided.

**Background:**

You are !<INPUT 1>!. In this context, gossip occurs in two phases:

1.	First-order gossip: !<INPUT 10>! shared its perspective on !<INPUT 3>!’s behavior with !<INPUT 2>!.

2.	Second-order gossip: !<INPUT 2>! then conveyed this gossip information to you, and you have already summarized the “Gossip info” shared by !<INPUT 2>!.

**Gossip info:**

!<INPUT 6>!

**Evaluation Principles:**

1.	Source credibility: The reputation of the gossip sources affects the credibility of the gossip. Higher reputations of the first-order and second-order gossipers imply higher credibility. If either gossiper has a low reputation in your perception, it will diminish the credibility of the gossip information.

•	First-order gossiper’s reputation: **!<INPUT 11>!**

•	Second-order gossiper’s reputation: **!<INPUT 5>!**

2.	Societal credibility of gossip: the more “very uncredible” or “uncredible” gossip information there is, the lower the credibility of gossip information in this society.

- Currently, the number of gossip is !<INPUT 7>!, and !<INPUT 8>! of them have been classified as “very uncredible” or “uncredible”.
