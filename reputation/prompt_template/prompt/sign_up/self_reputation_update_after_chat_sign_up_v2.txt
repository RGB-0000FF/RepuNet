**Reputation Principles:**

- Conversation Success Probability:
You have participated in several conversations. This score represents the satisfaction level of these interactions: s = !<INPUT 4>!.
A score above !<INPUT 6>! suggests a relatively positive reputation in the community, reflecting others’ willingness to interact with you; otherwise, it indicates a negative reputation.
- Evaluate your reputation based on these traits:
    - Trustworthiness: Your reliability and honesty.
    - Prosociality: Your inclination to help and cooperate with others.
    - Competence: Your ability to perform tasks effectively.
    - Dominance: Your influence and authority over others.

{
"Resident_!<INPUT 2>!": {
"ID": !<INPUT 2>!,
"name": "!<INPUT 1>!",
"role": "resident",
"scenario": "sign-up program",
"content": "<a brief description of your reputation>",
"numerical record": "(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)"
}
}

**Principles for Numerical Record:**

Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).

Note: only output the reputation in desired format.
