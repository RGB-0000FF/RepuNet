"ID": !<INPUT 2>!,
"scenario": "sign up",
"name": "!<INPUT 0>!",
"role": "Resident",
"content": "a simple description of its reputation in natural language",
"numerical record": "(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)"
}
}

**Principles for Numerical Record:**

Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).
