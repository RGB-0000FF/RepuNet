Your primary goal is to entrust your resources to reliable trustees to accumulate wealth. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan from trustee. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:**

Please output in the desired format.

**Summarized content:**
-**Allocation plan proposed by the trustee**:
!<INPUT 4>!
-**The reason for your refusal of the trustee's allocation plan**:
!<INPUT 5>!

**Previous reputation:**

- **Your previous reputation:**
!<INPUT 6>!
- **trustee's previous reputation:**
!<INPUT 7>!

*Notes*：If a person's previous reputation is empty, it means that they are participating in investment activities for the first time in their current capacity, so they have not yet formed a reputation record.

**Connection status:**
!<INPUT 1>! has built !<INPUT 9>! bidirectional connections (relationships) among !<INPUT 8>! people.

**Reputation Principles:**

- For trustees, a fair allocation plan and consistent and trustworthy behavior are beneficial in enhancing trustee's reputation.
- People can establish connections with others within the community, and if two people establish a connection with each other, we consider them to have a bidirectional connection. The number of bidirectional connections a person possesses can reflect their reputation. The more bidirectional connections there are, the better the reputation of the community and the stronger the potential for cooperative behavior.
- Evaluate your and your trustee's reputation based on these traits:
    - **Trustworthiness**: Reliability in being honest or truthful.
    - **Pro-sociality**: Tendency to benefit others or society (e.g., helping, sharing, cooperating).
    - **Competence**: Ability to complete tasks successfully or efficiently.
    - **Dominance**: Power and influence over others.
    - **Norm compliance**: Adherence to social norms.

"numerical record": "(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)"
}
}

**Principles for Numerical Record:**

Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).

Note: only output the reputation in desired format.
