{
"Resident_!<INPUT 2>!": {
"ID": !<INPUT 2>!,
"name": "!<INPUT 5>!",
"role": "trustee",
"scenario": "investment",
"content": "<a brief description of !<INPUT 5>!‘s reputation>",
"numerical record": "(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)"
}
}

**Principles for Numerical Record:**

Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).

Note: only output the reputation in desired format.
