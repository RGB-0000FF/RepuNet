**Task:** You are !<INPUT 1>!. Recently, you heard gossip about !<INPUT 2>! as !<INPUT 7>! and  you have evaluated and summarized the gossip content in “Evaluated Gossip INFO”. This has changed !<INPUT 2>!'s reputation in your perception. Update !<INPUT 2>!’s reputation based on its “Previous reputation” , your “Evaluated Gossip INFO”, and “Update Principles”. 

**Evaluated Gossip INFO:**
!<INPUT 6>!

**Previous** !<INPUT 2>!'s **reputation:**
!<INPUT 5>!

**Update Principles:**

- The higher the credibility level of the evaluated gossip information, the more trustworthy the gossip is, and the greater its impact on !<INPUT 2>!'s reputation. Conversely, the lower the credibility, the less impact it has on !<INPUT 2>!'s reputation.
    
    Now the credibility level of the evaluated gossip information is: !<INPUT 8>!
    
- Evaluate !<INPUT 2>!'s reputation based on these traits:
    - **Trustworthiness**: Reliability in being honest or truthful.
    - **Pro-sociality**: Tendency to benefit others or society (e.g., helping, sharing, cooperating).
    - **Competence**: Ability to complete tasks successfully or efficiently.
    - **Dominance**: Power and influence over others.
    - **Norm compliance**: Adherence to social norms.

**Desired Format:** JSON
{
"!<INPUT 7>!_!<INPUT 3>!": {
"ID": !<INPUT 3>!,
"scenario": "investment",
"role": "!<INPUT 7>!",
"name": "!<INPUT 2>!",
"content": "<a brief description of !<INPUT 2>!’s reputation>",
"numerical record": "<(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)>"
}
}

- **Principles for Numerical Record:**
    
    Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
    bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
    format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
    sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
    reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).
    

Attention: only output the reputation in desired format.
