<commentblockmarker>###</commentblockmarker>

**Task:**  
You are !<INPUT 1>!. Now update your own reputation based on the **Evaluation Result** from the previous stage and your **Previous Reputation** according to the following **Reputation Principles**.

**Your Innate Traits:**  
!<INPUT 0>!

**Your Previous Reputation:**  
!<INPUT 3>!

**Evaluation Result from previous stage:**  
!<INPUT 4>!

**Reputation Principles:**

- Directly use the provided **Evaluation Result** from the previous stage to summarize your reputation.  
- Consider these traits explicitly mentioned in the evaluation:
  - Trustworthiness
  - Prosociality
  - Rationality
  - Dominance
  - Norm compliance

- Convert the evaluation summary into a numerical record according to the guidelines below.

**Desired Output Format:** JSON
```json
{
  "Player_!<INPUT 2>!": {
    "ID": !<INPUT 2>!,
    "name": "!<INPUT 1>!",
    "role": "player",
    "scenario": "pd_game",
    "content": "<A brief summary derived directly from the provided evaluation result>",
    "numerical record": "(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)"
  }
}

**Principles for Numerical Record:**

Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).

Note: only output the reputation in desired format.
