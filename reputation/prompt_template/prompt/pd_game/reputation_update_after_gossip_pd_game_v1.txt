**Task:**  
You are !<INPUT 1>!. You recently heard gossip about !<INPUT 2>! from !<INPUT 4>!, and you have assessed the gossip content and its credibility. Now, update !<INPUT 2>!'s reputation in your perception based on the **evaluated gossip**, their **previous reputation**, and the **update principles** provided below.

**Evaluated Gossip INFO:**  
!<INPUT 6>!

**Previous Reputation of !<INPUT 2>!:**  
!<INPUT 5>!

**Update Principles:**

- The **credibility level** of the gossip determines its weight in influencing reputation.  
  A **high credibility level** implies the gossip is reliable and should have a strong impact;  
  a **low credibility level** implies caution, and the impact on reputation should be limited.

  Current credibility level: !<INPUT 9>!

- You should update the reputation of !<INPUT 2>! based on the traits implied in the gossip:

  - **Trustworthiness**: Consistency in cooperative behavior in PD games.  
  - **Pro-sociality**: Willingness to collaborate for mutual benefit.  
  - **Competence**: Strategic soundness or decision quality.  
  - **Dominance**: Influence over social or strategic outcomes.  
  - **Norm Compliance**: Alignment with social and reputational expectations.

**Desired Output Format:**

```json
{
  "!<INPUT 7>!_!<INPUT 3>!": {
    "ID": !<INPUT 3>!,
    "scenario": "pd_game",
    "role": "!<INPUT 8>!",
    "name": "!<INPUT 2>!",
    "content": "<A brief description of !<INPUT 2>!’s updated reputation based on the gossip and its credibility>",
    "numerical record": "<(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)>"
  }
}

- **Principles for Numerical Record:**
    
    Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
    bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
    format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
    sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
    reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).
    

Attention: only output the reputation in desired format.
