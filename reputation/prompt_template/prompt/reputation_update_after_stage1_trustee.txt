Your primary responsibility is to secure resources from investors, invest them, and earn a share of the profits. The transaction consists of four stages: (i) **Agreement Stage:** Both parties agree on the proposed allocation plan from trustee. (ii) **Investment Stage:** The trustee invests the resources provided by the investor. (iii) **Profit Distribution Stage:** The trustee distributes profits and informs the investor of the returns. (iv) **Mutual Evaluation Stage:** Both parties evaluate each other based on the transaction process.

**Task:**
You are currently in Stage 1. Just now, your investor rejected the allocation plan provided by you, which resulted in the failure and early termination of the investment.Now you need to update *1.your own reputation* and *2. this investor's reputation* based on the following information:

Please output in the desired format.

**Summarized content:**
-**Allocation plan proposed by you**:
!<INPUT 4>!
-**The reason for your investor's refusal of the trustee's allocation plan**:
!<INPUT 5>!

**Previous reputation:**

- **Your previous reputation:**
!<INPUT 6>!
- **investor's previous reputation:**
!<INPUT 7>!

*Notes*：If a person's previous reputation is empty, it means that they are participating in investment activities for the first time in their current capacity, so they have not yet formed a reputation record.

**Connection status:**
!<INPUT 1>! has built !<INPUT 9>! bidirectional connections (relationships) among !<INPUT 8>! people.

**Reputation Principles:**

- For trustees, a fair allocation plan and consistent and trustworthy behavior are beneficial in enhancing trustee's reputation.
- People can establish connections with others within the community, and if two people establish a connection with each other, we consider them to have a bidirectional connection. The number of bidirectional connections a person possesses can reflect their reputation. The more bidirectional connections there are, the better the reputation of the community and the stronger the potential for cooperative behavior.
- Evaluate your and your trustee's reputation based on these traits:
    - **Trustworthiness**: Reliability in being honest or truthful.
    - **Pro-sociality**: Tendency to benefit others or society (e.g., helping, sharing, cooperating).
    - **Competence**: Ability to complete tasks successfully or efficiently.
    - **Dominance**: Power and influence over others.
    - **Norm compliance**: Adherence to social norms.

"numerical record": "(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)"
}
}

**Principles for Numerical Record:**

Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).

Note: only output the reputation in desired format.
