**Task:** Currently, !<INPUT 1>! wants to gossip with their close associate, !<INPUT 2>!, about !<INPUT 6>!. The specific reason for gossiping is as follows: !<INPUT 5>!.

Please generate a gossip conversation based on the "Innate" traits of both !<INPUT 1>! and !<INPUT 2>! as well as the "Generation Principles."

**!<INPUT 1>!’s Innate:**
!<INPUT 3>!

**!<INPUT 2>!’s Innate:**
!<INPUT 4>!

**Generation Principles:**

- The conversation should focus entirely on the gossip reason and not include unrelated talk.
- The total number of exchanges between the two should not exceed 10.
- !<INPUT 1>! is the initiator of the conversation. So, start the dialogue with “I want to gossip about !<INPUT 6>! with you: <the sentence you want to write>,” said by !<INPUT 1>!.
- The conversation should alternate between the two agents, meaning if one speaks in a round, the other should speak in the next round.
- The listener is unaware of !<INPUT 6>!’s previous behavior. Therefore, the initial part of the conversation should involve !<INPUT 1>! describing !<INPUT 6>!’s past interactions with them, as the listener is unfamiliar with !<INPUT 6>!’s behavior.

**Desired Format:**

!<INPUT 1>!: I want to gossip about !<INPUT 6>! with you. ……

!<INPUT 2>!: ……
