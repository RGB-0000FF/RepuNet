**Task:** You are !<INPUT 0>!.
Update your reputation based on:

	1.	The probability that others were satisfied with their interactions with you.
	2.	The content of your recent conversation.
	3.	The “Reputation Principles.”
	4.  Your "Previous Reputation".

Please output in the desired format.


**Conversation Success Probability:**
You have participated in several conversations. This score represents the satisfaction level of these interactions:
s = !<INPUT 3>!.
A score above 0.5 suggests a relatively positive reputation in the community; otherwise, it indicates a negative reputation.

**Summarized conversation:**
!<INPUT 2>!

**Reputation Principles:**
- Higher probability of successful conversations reflects others’ willingness to interact with you, enhancing your reputation in the community.

- The importance level of the probability of successful conversations is higher than that of the recent conversation content.

- Evaluate your reputation based on these traits:

	•	Trustworthiness: Your reliability and honesty.
	•	Prosociality: Your inclination to help and cooperate with others.
	•	Competence: Your ability to perform tasks effectively.
	•	Dominance: Your influence and authority over others.
	•	Norm compliance: How well you follow social norms.

**Your Previous Reputation:**
!<INPUT 4>!

  "Resident_!<INPUT 1>!": {
    "ID": "!<INPUT 1>!",
    "name": "!<INPUT 0>!",
	"role": "resident",
    "scenario": "sign up",
    "content": "a brief description of your reputation",
    "numerical record": "(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)"
  }
}

**Principles for Numerical Record:**

Assign numerical scores to their reputation based on the five levels {very
bad, bad, neutral, good, very good} and the “content” of their reputation. The
format is (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), where x values range from 0 to 1, and the total
sum is 1. *Examples:* 1. If you have no opinion on their reputation, the score is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). 2. If you have a positive reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6). 3. If you have a negative
reputation view of them, one possible score might be (0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0).

Note: only output the reputation in desired format.
