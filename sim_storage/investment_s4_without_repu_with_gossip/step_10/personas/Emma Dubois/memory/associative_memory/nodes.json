Did you discuss your concerns with them?\n\nEmma Dubois: Yes, I addressed it, but there seemed to be resistance to change, which only made me more determined to advocate for a better model.\n\nJuan Carlos Reyes: That makes sense. It\u2019s crucial to foster trust among partners, especially when profits are at stake. What are your thoughts on proposing an alternative?\n\nEmma Dubois: I\u2019m really considering it; an equitable model would not only benefit us but also boost morale and innovation among everyone involved.\n\nJuan Carlos Reyes: Absolutely! A proposal emphasizing shared success could definitely reshape the partnership dynamic positively.\n\nEmma Dubois: Exactly!
