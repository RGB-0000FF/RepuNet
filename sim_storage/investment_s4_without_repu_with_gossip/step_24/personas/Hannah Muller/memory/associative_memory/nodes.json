I want to ensure we maintain a fair and clear relationship moving forward.\n\nHannah Muller: Good call. Establishing trust is crucial, especially with all the newfound complexity in your investment strategies.\n\nHiroshi Tanaka: Exactly. While I value my independence, collaborating effectively also requires a level of accountability from my partners.\n\nHannah Muller: Absolutely. Your structured approach and focus on profit-sharing should help in navigating these issues if Aisha is willing to cooperate.\n\nHiroshi Tanaka: I hope so. I\u2019ve aimed for a system that benefits everyone involved, but I need to re-evaluate if the trust isn't upheld.\n\nHannah Muller: Smart move.
