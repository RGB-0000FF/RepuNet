Transparency is key in partnerships. Have you confronted her about the discrepancies?\n\nHiroshi Tanaka: Not yet, but I\u2019m planning to. I want to ensure we maintain a fair and clear relationship moving forward.\n\nHannah Muller: Good call. Establishing trust is crucial, especially with all the newfound complexity in your investment strategies.\n\nHiroshi Tanaka: Exactly. While I value my independence, collaborating effectively also requires a level of accountability from my partners.\n\nHannah Muller: Absolutely. Your structured approach and focus on profit-sharing should help in navigating these issues if Aisha is willing to cooperate.\n\nHiroshi Tanaka: I hope so. I\u2019ve aimed for a system that benefits everyone involved, but I need to re-evaluate if the trust isn't upheld.\n\nHannah Muller: Smart move. If she\u2019s not honest, it might be time to reconsider your partnerships for future investments.\n\nHiroshi Tanaka: Right.
