It\u2019s creating a rift that could threaten future collaborations.\n\nAisha Ibrahim: I can understand that. Transparency is key in maintaining those partnerships. Have you spoken to the trustees about this issue?\n\nRobert Miller: Not yet, but I plan to address it. I believe it's essential to emphasize the importance of equitable profit distribution moving forward.\n\nAisha Ibrahim: Absolutely. You should highlight your commitment to fairness and how it can rebuild trust among all parties involved.\n\nRobert Miller: Exactly!
