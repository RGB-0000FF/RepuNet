I can\u2019t help but think it reflects poorly on their negotiating skills.\n\nAkiko Sato: It does! I\u2019ve always believed in leveling the playing field. If you work together, you can achieve so much more.\n\nElena Ivanova: I agree. I focus on equitable profit-sharing to ensure everyone feels valued. It\u2019s the smart approach to long-term success.\n\nAkiko Sato: Absolutely! My model is similar, and it\u2019s great to see everyone benefit from our joint efforts. \n\nElena Ivanova: It makes a significant difference in building trust. I wish more investors understood that!\n\nAkiko Sato: Definitely! A strong collaborative spirit is key in this industry.
