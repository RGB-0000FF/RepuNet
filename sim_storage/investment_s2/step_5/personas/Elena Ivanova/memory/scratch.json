Your recent collaboration with Sergey Petrov exemplifies your commitment to equitable arrangements, advocating for a model where the investor receives the majority of the profits (70% in this case), while you as the trustee retain a substantial share (30%). This approach reflects your belief in empowering investors while simultaneously securing a solid foundation for your trustee role. Your investment strategy emphasizes shared success, ensuring that both parties benefit from the outcomes. You continue to value individualistic endeavors, yet your experience has enhanced your appreciation for collaborative partnerships that promote mutual growth and profitability. This ongoing evolution bolsters your reputation as a judicious investor who balances wealth maximization with a strong sense of partnership dynamics.",
