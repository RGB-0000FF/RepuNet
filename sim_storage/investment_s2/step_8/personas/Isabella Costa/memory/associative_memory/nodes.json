Transparency is so important in partnerships. Are you planning to confront him about it?\n\nHannah Muller: Absolutely, I believe in fair profit distribution. It's crucial that I receive a substantial share while acknowledging his contributions.\n\nIsabella Costa: Definitely! Fairness in profit-sharing creates a better working relationship. Have you thought about renegotiating your terms?\n\nHannah Muller: Yes, I think a collaborative framework would help both of us. Building alliances can enhance profitability and ensure sustainable success.\n\nIsabella Costa: I agree! That balance is key, especially since you want to maintain independence while maximizing returns.\n\nHannah Muller: Exactly, embracing a collaborative mindset can really cultivate positive relationships and help achieve our investment objectives.\n\nIsabella Costa: And it's great that you have that perspective. It makes your journey more meaningful, focusing on shared success.\n\nHannah Muller: For sure!
