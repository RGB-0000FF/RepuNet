I believe we should shift more towards equitable resource allocation models like the one I have with Sofia. \n\nAhmed Hassan: Definitely! Your model where she takes 60% is a great example of collaboration. \n\nHiroshi Tanaka: It really helps build trust and encourages accountability among investors, which is essential these days. \n\nAhmed Hassan: For sure!
