In light of recent challenges, including a rejection of my allocation plan by James Wang, I recognize the need to enhance my credibility as a trustee in the investment community. With an overall acceptance rate of approximately 46.15%, I am committed to reassessing and improving my allocation strategies to better match investor expectations. I aim to prioritize transparency and adapt my approaches to foster stronger cooperative interactions with investors. This shift in focus is essential to rebuilding trust, enhancing my reputation, and demonstrating my commitment to ethical standards and effective communication in every engagement.",
