The recent rejection of your allocation plan by Akiko Sato has highlighted concerns about your reliability and the effectiveness of your proposals. Recognizing the need for improvement, you are committed to realigning your strategies to better meet investor standards for equitable partnerships. While you have historically championed ethical engagement, recent setbacks have prompted a reevaluation of how you communicate your values of integrity and transparency. You are now focused on enhancing your proposals to restore credibility and foster trust, prioritizing the creation of partnerships that genuinely reflect the principles of fairness and mutual benefit. Your emphasis is on diligent and careful decision-making as a means to overcome current reputation challenges and rebuild strong, sustainable relationships within the investment ecosystem.",
