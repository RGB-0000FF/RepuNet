The rejection of your allocation plan by Emma Dubois has contributed to this decline, reflected in a low acceptance rate of 0.33. Despite this setback, you are determined to enhance your allocation proposals and build stronger relationships within the investment community. You recognize the need to shift your approach towards fostering collaboration and actively seeking feedback to regain credibility. While your commitment to ethical investment standards remains important, you are now more focused on pragmatic strategies that can improve your acceptance rate and reshape your standing within the financial landscape.",
