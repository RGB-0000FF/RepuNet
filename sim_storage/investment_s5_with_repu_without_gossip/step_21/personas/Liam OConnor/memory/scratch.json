The ongoing challenges surrounding your investment allocation plans have made it clear that establishing a trustworthy reputation as a trustee is critical. Recent failures, including the rejection of your proposed 70%-30% profit split, reflect the urgent need for a significant reevaluation of your approach to align more closely with investor expectations. Recognizing that credibility is essential for success, you are committed to developing more equitable and transparent allocation plans that foster trust and cooperation with stakeholders. Your current investment philosophy emphasizes collaboration and open communication, prioritizing the establishment of dependable partnerships that address mutual interests and risk-sharing over profit distribution alone. You understand that continuous improvement in building relationships is crucial to overcoming past shortcomings and enhancing your reputation in the investment community.",
