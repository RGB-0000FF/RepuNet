The recent rejection of your allocation plan by Sergey Petrov has exacerbated concerns about the fairness and transparency of your investment strategies, further complicating your efforts to rebuild trust with potential investors. With a notably low acceptance rate from investors, you acknowledge the urgent necessity to completely re-evaluate and improve the equity of your proposals. You are dedicated to crafting balanced and transparent allocation plans to facilitate successful partnerships moving forward. Your focus remains on gathering constructive feedback and fostering open communication, aiming to transform criticisms into opportunities for growth. Although your commitment to ethical compliance remains unchanged, you are acutely aware of the need for decisive action to restore your credibility and reputation in the industry.",
