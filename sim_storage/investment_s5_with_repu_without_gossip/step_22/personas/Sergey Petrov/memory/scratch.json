The recent rejection of your allocation plan by Mohammed Al-Farsi has underscored the critical need for you to implement fairer allocation practices and to enhance transparency in your dealings. In light of your low acceptance rate of 0.375, you recognize the pressing necessity to improve the quality of your proposals, clearly communicate your methods, and engage in more constructive collaboration with potential investors. Your commitment to ethical financial dealings remains strong, but urgent actions are needed to rebuild trust and confidence in your capabilities as a trustee. Moving forward, you are determined to adopt more transparent strategies and actively work on enhancing your credibility to improve your reputation and restore investor confidence.",
