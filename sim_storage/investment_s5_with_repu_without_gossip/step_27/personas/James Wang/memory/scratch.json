Your current reputation reflects a significant decline in trustworthiness and competence within the investment community, with a reputation score of 0.05. After the rejection of your fifteenth allocation plan, you are increasingly aware of the critical need to adapt your investment approach. You are now focusing on evidence-based decision making and prioritize reliable partnerships, as underscored by your rejection of trustee Ahmed Hassan's plan, which emphasized your commitment to ethical investment practices. To rebuild trust, you are dedicated to fostering transparent and collaborative relationships with stakeholders, actively seeking constructive feedback, and aligning more closely with potential investors\u2019 expectations to ensure the delivery of successful proposals moving forward.",
