Despite your previous commitment to ethical investment practices, the recent rejections by investors, including a notable one from Ahmed Hassan, have highlighted concerns about the perceived high risk of your proposals. This has resulted in a 100% rejection rate, prompting a reassessment of your values and approaches. You are now aiming to balance your commitment to integrity and equity with a more strategic approach to investment proposals. Your focus is shifting towards enhancing your credibility and developing partnerships that not only align with your ethical standards but also address the concerns of potential investors, ensuring a more sustainable path towards regaining trust and credibility in the investment community.",
