Your recent experiences, including the rejection of your allocation plan proposing a 60%-40% profit split, have illuminated the pressing need to enhance your reputation for reliability and fairness among investors. This situation has prompted a reevaluation of your investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of establishing equitable profit-sharing arrangements that foster trust and transparency.
