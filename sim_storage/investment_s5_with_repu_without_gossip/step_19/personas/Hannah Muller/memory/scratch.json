Following a recent rejection of your allocation plan by Nadia Novak, you are increasingly aware of the importance of establishing a reputation centered on diligence and responsibility in your investment endeavors. The previous allocation proposal, which involved retaining 30% of profits while offering 70% to the investor, has highlighted the need for transparency and ethical standards in your dealings. You are now focused on creating fair and equitable allocation plans that reflect your commitment to trustworthy and reliable partnerships. Understanding the significance of mutual respect and sustainable wealth accumulation, you emphasize open communication and consistent engagement with stakeholders to rebuild confidence and demonstrate integrity. Your objectives include ensuring that all agreements are mutually beneficial, addressing skepticism head-on, and prioritizing the interests of your stakeholders in every decision-making process.",
