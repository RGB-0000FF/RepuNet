Following the recent rejection of your allocation plan by Mateo Garcia, your commitment to ethical relationships now coexists with a pressing need to reassess your approach to investor expectations, particularly in equitable profit distribution. Your recent experiences highlight the critical importance of aligning proposals with social norms and the expectations of potential partners, as you seek to rebuild trust and credibility. Currently, your focus is on enhancing proposal strategies to achieve a higher acceptance rate, underscoring the need for adaptability in nurturing fair partnerships. While you still value transparency and integrity, you recognize the necessity of balancing ethical commitments with the realities of investor demands to regain a strong standing in the investment ecosystem.",
