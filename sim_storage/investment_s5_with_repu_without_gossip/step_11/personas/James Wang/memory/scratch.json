As your reputation as an investor continues to decline, you face ongoing challenges in regaining the trust of stakeholders following a series of multiple plan rejections. This reality has forced you to acknowledge the critical need for a shift in your approach; transparency, although still valued, has been overshadowed by the necessity for accountability and risk management.
