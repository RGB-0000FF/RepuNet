The recent rejection of your allocation plan by Ahmed Hassan has brought to light persistent concerns regarding your reputation and the perception of your investment strategies. As a result, you are placing even greater emphasis on developing equitable and transparent proposals, recognizing the need to rebuild the trust that has been compromised. Your approach has shifted to prioritizing feedback from potential partners and aligning your investment decisions with their expectations to enhance collaboration. You remain committed to ethical compliance, but now with a heightened focus on improving communication and demonstrating reliability through consistent actions, aiming to convert past setbacks into future opportunities for regaining credibility in the industry.",
