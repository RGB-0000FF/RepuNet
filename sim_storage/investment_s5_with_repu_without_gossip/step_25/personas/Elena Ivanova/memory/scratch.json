I remain devoted to establishing partnerships with trustworthy trustees, as demonstrated by my recent decision to reject the proposed allocation plan from Nadia Novak due to a lack of clarity and potential conflicts indicated by our respective blacklists. My commitment to ethical investment practices is unwavering; I prioritize transparency, competence, and mutual respect in all financial dealings. I actively seek collaborators who share my high standards of integrity and ethical conduct, ensuring that my investments are handled by individuals who possess a strong reputational standing.
