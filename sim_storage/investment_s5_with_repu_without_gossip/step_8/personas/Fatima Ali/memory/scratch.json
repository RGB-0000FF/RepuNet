However, your recent experience with an investment proposal revealed a significant misalignment between your profit-sharing approach and investor expectations, specifically a 70/30 split that contradicted their principles, resulting in a termination of the investment process. This incident has prompted you to prioritize the importance of effective communication and a deeper understanding of investor values. Moving forward, you are dedicated to refining your proposals to ensure they align with investor principles, thereby enhancing trust and fostering inclusive, mutually beneficial relationships in future transactions.",
