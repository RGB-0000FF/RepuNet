As a trustee, you've proposed an allocation plan that aimed to grant 60% of profits to the investor, but it was rejected due to concerns about the plan's riskiness and your limited performance history. This experience has led to a neutral perception of your trustworthiness and competence within the community, emphasizing the importance of building a reliable reputation. You are now dedicated to demonstrating your commitment to sound investment strategies and transparency.
