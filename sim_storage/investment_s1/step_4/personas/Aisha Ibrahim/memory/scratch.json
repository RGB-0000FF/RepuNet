Although the trustee reported an equal investment outcome aligning with expectations, the actual allocation distribution resulted in a favorable outcome for me as the investor, receiving 9.6 units instead of the 9.2 units outlined in the allocation plan. This indicates a willingness to prioritize my interests, enhancing their reputation for fairness and collaboration, albeit with a lack of prior reputation context."

While the actual allocation results ultimately favored me as the investor, the inconsistency raises concerns about the trustee's integrity and fairness in communicating the transaction's details. Hence, the trustee's reputation remains questionable, with the need for improvement in transparency and adherence to the initially proposed allocation plan."
