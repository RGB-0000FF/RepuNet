      "complaint_reason": "The trustee initially proposed a fair allocation plan, and despite the reported resource quantity matching the actual investment outcome, the actual allocation result diverged from the proposed distribution. While I received a higher percentage than anticipated, this lack of alignment with the initial proposal raises questions regarding the trustee\u2019s transparency and honesty. It appears that their behavior lacks the integrity that I had hoped for, which may necessitate caution in future interactions. Overall, their reputation as a trustee reflects a mixed record, requiring improvement in trustworthiness."
