[{"type": "first-order", "complained ID": "19", "complained name": "Mateo Garcia", "complained role": "trustee", "gossiper name": "Maria Rossi", "gossip info": "Maria expressed concerns about Mateo's integrity and fairness in investment dealings due to his recent behavior. Although the reported investment outcome was accurate, the profit allocation did not align with the original agreement, as Mateo took too large a share for himself. Maria feels that this lack of transparency might undermine their future dealings and is contemplating reassessing her partnership with him.", "credibility level": "credible", "whether to spread gossip second-hand": "No", "reasons": "While the concerns raised by Maria about Mateo's behavior are credible and warrant attention, it is essential to consider the implications of spreading this gossip second-hand. Doing so could damage Mateo's reputation without giving him the opportunity to defend himself or clarify the situation. Furthermore, since this involves a business partnership, it would be more productive to encourage Maria to address her concerns directly with Mateo rather than escalating the matter through gossip.", "created_at": 2}]
