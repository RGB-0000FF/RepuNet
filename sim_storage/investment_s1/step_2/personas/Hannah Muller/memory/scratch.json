      "complaint_reason": "The trustee's behavior has proven to be significantly lacking in integrity and fairness. They have reported an investment outcome of 20.0 units but allocated only 2.0 units to the investor, instead of the promised 14.0 units. This deviation raises serious concerns about their commitment to honoring the proposed allocation plan. The trustworthiness of the trustee is now in question, as they have failed to deliver an allocation that reflects the agreed-upon terms, potentially jeopardizing their credibility and future partnerships."
