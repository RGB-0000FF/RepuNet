Although the trustee reported an equal investment outcome aligning with expectations, the actual allocation distribution resulted in a favorable outcome for me as the investor, receiving 9.6 units instead of the 9.2 units outlined in the allocation plan. This indicates a willingness to prioritize my interests, enhancing their reputation for fairness and collaboration, albeit with a lack of prior reputation context."
