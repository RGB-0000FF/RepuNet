While the trustee has reported the investment outcome accurately, the willingness to allocate more than promised raises questions about their transparency and overall integrity. This creates a mixed impression; they may be acting in a potentially self-serving manner, straying from the expected integrity in the investment process."

      "complaint_reason": "The trustee's behavior throughout this transaction raises concerns regarding integrity and fairness. While they reported the investment outcome accurately at 65.86 units, the actual distribution deviated from the proposed allocation plan. The trustee received 19.76 units instead of the anticipated 19.76 (30% of 65.86), resulting in a larger allocation to me than promised. This discrepancy reflects a lack of clarity in communication and raises doubts about their commitment to transparency. Therefore, their reputation requires cautious assessment moving forward."
