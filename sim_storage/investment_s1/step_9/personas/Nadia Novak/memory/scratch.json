      "complaint_reason": "The trustee proposed an allocation plan that initially seemed equitable, promising 70% of profits to me as the investor. However, the reported investment outcome of 20.0 units, which resulted in both myself and the trustee receiving 10.0 units each, deviates from the intended agreement. This mismatch raises concerns about the integrity and fairness of the trustee's actions, as they received more than they were entitled to based on the initial agreement. Although the distribution is technically balanced, the discrepancy in reported versus actual outcomes suggests a lack of transparency."
