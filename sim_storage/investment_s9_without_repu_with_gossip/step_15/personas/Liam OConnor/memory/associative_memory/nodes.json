We need to be vigilant about who we partner with, ensuring our values align with theirs.\n\nLiam OConnor: But if Fatima provides benefits, does that outweigh the risks? Sometimes ethics take a backseat to opportunity.\n\nAkiko Sato: True, but we must think about the collective impact, not just individual gains.\n\nLiam OConnor: Fair point.
