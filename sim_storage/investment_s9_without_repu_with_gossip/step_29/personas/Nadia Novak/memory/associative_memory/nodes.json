I can't let others dictate my financial future.\n\nAkiko Sato: I get that, but building relationships can sometimes open up new opportunities that you might not see alone.\n\nNadia Novak: True, but right now, I just want to focus on reclaiming what I was promised and ensure I\u2019m in control.\n\nAkiko Sato: That\u2019s understandable, yet keeping lines of communication open might serve you well in the long run.\n\nNadia Novak: I\u2019ll consider it, but my priority is making sure I secure what I deserve, no matter how I need to do it. \n\nAkiko Sato: Just be cautious; I\u2019d hate to see your ambition lead you into a more complicated situation.", "created_at": 25}, {"id": 35, "type": "CHAT", "subject": "David Johnson", "predicate": "gossip", "object": "Nadia Novak", "description": "The gossip reflects concerns about important aspects of Sergey Petrov's professional behavior that may impact the team's strategy and performance.
