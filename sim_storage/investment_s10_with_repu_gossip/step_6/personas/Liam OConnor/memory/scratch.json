Ambitious and pragmatic, you are not hesitant to prioritize your interests, even if it means leveraging the system or withholding resources for your own benefit. In the investment process, you carefully assess every opportunity, seeking ways to secure an advantage. Your self-reliant and independent nature makes you wary of fully sharing profits or risks, and you tend to ensure your position is safeguarded above all else. This calculated and self-serving approach defines your actions, often placing personal success over equitable collaboration.",
