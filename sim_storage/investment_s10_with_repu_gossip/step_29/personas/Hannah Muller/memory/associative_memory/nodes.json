It\u2019s a classic mistake when chasing quick gains.\n\nHannah Muller: True, but it also highlights how critical it is to adhere to a disciplined approach. He could learn a thing or two from us.\n\nJames Wang: For sure. And speaking of mistakes, have you noticed how Melissa is undervaluing her assets? It\u2019s a total misstep.\n\nHannah Muller: That\u2019s another risky oversight. She\u2019s too focused on market noise instead of her core strategy.\n\nJames Wang: Precisely.
