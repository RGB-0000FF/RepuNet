It\u2019s a reminder to keep my cards close to my chest and not reveal too much.\n\nRobert Miller: True, but surely we can find a balance between being cautious and openly collaborating for the greater good?\n\nLiam OConnor: Balance is fine, but I prefer to safeguard my position first, especially when the stakes are high.\n\nRobert Miller: Fair enough, but won't that kind of approach deter potential partners in the long run?\n\nLiam OConnor: Possibly, but I'd rather be secure than take unnecessary risks with my investments.\n\nRobert Miller: I get that, but true growth often comes from sharing opportunities and risks together.\n\nLiam OConnor: Sure, but I'll always prioritize my interests; that's how I navigate the investment landscape.\n\nRobert Miller: And I respect that, just know that aligning interests can lead to even bigger successes later on.", "created_at": 2}]
