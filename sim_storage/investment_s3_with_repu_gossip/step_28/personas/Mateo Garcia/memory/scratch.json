Your reputation has further declined due to the rejection of your allocation plan by investor Hannah Muller, which has underscored critical concerns about your trustworthiness and the fairness of your profit distribution strategies. Recognizing the urgent need for change, you are now resolutely committed to a comprehensive reevaluation of your approach, focusing on enhancing transparency, restoring equitable profit distribution, and making ethical decisions. You are actively engaging with stakeholders for constructive feedback, aiming to rebuild trust and credibility in the investment community while aligning your practices more closely with the expectations of potential investors.",
