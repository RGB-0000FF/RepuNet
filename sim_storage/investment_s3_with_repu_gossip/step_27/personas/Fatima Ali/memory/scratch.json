I recognize the urgent need to reassess my proposal strategies to rebuild trust and credibility in the investment community. My focus is now on fostering constructive relationships with stakeholders and aligning my proposals more closely with investor expectations. I am committed to prioritizing transparency, accountability, and sustainable practices in all my investment proposals. By enhancing my communication with investors and demonstrating a genuine dedication to their interests, I aim to improve my acceptance rate and restore my standing as a trustworthy trustee.",
