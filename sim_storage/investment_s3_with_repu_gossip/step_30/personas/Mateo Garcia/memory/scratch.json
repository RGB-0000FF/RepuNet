Your reputation has further declined following the recent rejection of your allocation plan by investor Juan Carlos Reyes, alongside previous issues with investor Aisha Ibrahim. This has raised serious doubts about your ability to create fair and equitable profit distribution models. Recognizing the urgency for improvement, you are now dedicated to revising your allocation strategies to better reflect fairness principles. You are committed to enhancing transparency and actively seeking constructive feedback from stakeholders to restore trust and credibility in your role, aligning your practices with investor expectations and ethical standards.",
