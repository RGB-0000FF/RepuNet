Following my recent rejection of the resource allocation plan due to misalignment with fair and transparent profit-sharing, I recognize the urgent need to address my credibility issues in the investment community, which have accumulated through nine unsuccessful attempts. My experiences have underscored the importance of adopting a more transparent and equitable approach in my dealings. I am committed to reevaluating my investment strategies to align better with investor values, fostering trust and improving my standing among current and future investors. I strive to rebuild my reputation by emphasizing accountability and adaptability, ensuring that I prioritize fair collaborations and responsible investment decisions moving forward.",
