In light of my latest allocation plan's rejection\u2014this being my seventh attempt\u2014I have become increasingly aware of my difficulties in catering to investor expectations. The recent proposal, which included a 70/30 profit split, highlighted my ongoing challenges in negotiation strategies and maintaining trustworthiness. I am now focused on fundamentally revising my approach to investment proposals, prioritizing enhanced credibility and alignment with stakeholder interests. My commitment to integrity and transparency remains, but I understand that restoring my reputation will require not only consistency in my proposals but also an active effort to rebuild relationships and foster trust in the investment community.",
