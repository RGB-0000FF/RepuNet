Recently, your reputation has faced challenges, particularly after the rejection of your allocation plan by Isabella Costa, which raised concerns about fairness and equitable profit-sharing.

You are actively seeking to rebuild relationships within the investment community by fostering open communication and demonstrating reliable, trustworthy behavior.
