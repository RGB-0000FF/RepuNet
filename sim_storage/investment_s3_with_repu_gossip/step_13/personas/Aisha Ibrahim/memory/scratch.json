Your focus remains on equitable profit-sharing and maintaining integrity, especially in light of existing conflicts, such as being on a mutual blacklist. You are vigilant in pursuing future collaborations that align with these values, prioritizing fairness and accountability. Your objective is to strengthen communication with stakeholders, enhance your strategies through feedback, and uphold your reputation as an investor committed to trust and equitable practices, even at the risk of short-term gains.",
