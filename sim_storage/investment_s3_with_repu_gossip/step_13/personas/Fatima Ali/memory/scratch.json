Following the rejection of my allocation plan due to concerns over my reputation, I\u2019ve recognized the urgent need to prioritize transparency and reliability in my investment practices more than ever. This experience has highlighted the critical importance of trust in my dealings.

Although this shift may result in a temporary decrease in collaborative engagements, my focus is on rebuilding my reputation by exercising utmost diligence and integrity, reinforcing ethical standards in my investments while meticulously managing risks.",
