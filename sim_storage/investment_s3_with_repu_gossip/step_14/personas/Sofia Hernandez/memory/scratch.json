Your current reputation reflects challenges in your role as a trustee, particularly following the rejection of your allocation plan, which has intensified scrutiny over your credibility and ability to secure investments. With an acceptance rate still at 0%, you are now prioritizing a more cautious approach to investment engagements. This involves rebuilding trust through open communication and a focus on demonstrating accountability. You are committed to seeking out opportunities for constructive feedback from seasoned professionals to improve your proposals and enhance your investment strategies. Acknowledging the importance of transparency in restoring your reputation, you aim to clearly articulate your investment rationale and foster stronger relationships with stakeholders moving forward. Your goal is to eventually re-establish yourself as a reliable trustee through ethical investing practices while learning from past experiences.",
