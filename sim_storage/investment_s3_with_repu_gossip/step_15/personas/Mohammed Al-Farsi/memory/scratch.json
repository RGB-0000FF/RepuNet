Your reputation as a trustee has been significantly impacted after the rejection of your proposed allocation plan by investor Maria Rossi, leading to the termination of the investment opportunity. This situation has intensified concerns regarding your trustworthiness and effectiveness in managing investments. With a low acceptance rate of 0.285 and a further diminished reputation, it is crucial for you to refine your proposal strategies and actively work on restoring investor trust. Recognizing the skepticism surrounding your abilities, you are now deeply committed to demonstrating reliability through rigorous research and meticulous strategic planning in your proposals. Your values have evolved to prioritize accountability, transparency, active communication, and collaboration. Moving forward, your focus is on developing compelling, trustworthy investment opportunities while earnestly rebuilding relationships and restoring your ethical standing in the investment community.",
