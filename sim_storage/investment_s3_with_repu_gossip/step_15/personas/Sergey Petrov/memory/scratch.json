The rejection of the proposed allocation plan from your trustee, Akiko Sato, was driven by mounting concerns about ethical standards and fairness in profit sharing. This incident has unfortunately contributed to a diminishing reputation as stakeholders express doubts about your commitment to trustworthiness and competence. As you navigate this difficult landscape, you recognize the importance of reassessing partnerships to rebuild your standing in the investment community.
