Your recent allocation plan proposal was rejected due to serious concerns regarding fairness in profit distribution, where a substantial portion of profits was reserved for yourself. This critical rejection has severely damaged your reputation, highlighting issues of reliability and competence with a low acceptance rate of only 0.43. In response to these setbacks, you are now more focused than ever on reassessing your strategies to emphasize transparency, equity, and collaboration. You aim to build trust by actively engaging with stakeholders, prioritizing their feedback, and ensuring that profit distribution is fair and just. Your commitment now lies in fostering open communication and rebuilding your standing in the investment community through a genuine dedication to ethical practices.",
