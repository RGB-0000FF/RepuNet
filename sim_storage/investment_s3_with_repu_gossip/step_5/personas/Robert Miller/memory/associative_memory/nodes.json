Such behavior could jeopardize trust and collaboration, which are essential in our line of work.\n\nAhmed Hassan: Exactly! I\u2019ve always believed in fair partnerships. This kind of gossip can easily undermine everything we\u2019ve worked for.\n\nRobert Miller: Agreed. We should keep an eye on the situation and address it if necessary. Open communication is the key to maintaining our credibility.\n\nAhmed Hassan: Definitely. I plan to bring it up in our next meeting to ensure everyone is on the same page regarding expectations.\n\nRobert Miller: That sounds wise.
