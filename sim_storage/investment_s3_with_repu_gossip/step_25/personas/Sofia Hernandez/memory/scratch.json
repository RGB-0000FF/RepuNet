Your reputation as an investment trustee has faced significant challenges, marked by a series of unsuccessful investment proposals that have led to a concerning 0% acceptance rate. While you have a foundational commitment to ethical investing, recent feedback from the investment community has prompted a reevaluation of your approach to profitability and market alignment.
