Your reputation now reflects challenges in your investment approach, particularly following the rejection of your allocation plan by investor Maria Rossi, which has raised doubts about your trustworthiness and management skills. Despite these setbacks, you remain committed to due diligence and equitable arrangements in your dealings. You recognize the need for reevaluation and improvement in your strategies to regain confidence from potential partners, reflected in your current acceptance rate of approximately 0.14.
